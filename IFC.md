IFC.py

Goals: take an IFC from FrameCAD, convert it into engineering documentation

Tasks:
Drag and drop ifc
Total weight
Area in each dimension
Remove 0,0,0 point 
$25 Give checkbox or toggle 
Option to remove 0,0,0 point
Metric or imperial output


$50 Calculate perimeter of footing from point cloud and show
$25 show total count and total weight of each stud type
$100 Auto determine if multiple story (hint, find the floors first)
$50 Show total moment and total forces on foundation and on each floor if multistory
$50 Show estimated linear load on perimeter of footing based on roof up and down pressure, as well as wall moments from wind
$50 Calculate roof perimeter and area show
$50 Calculate wind loads and present
$50 Calculate dead load 
$50 Calculate snow loads
$50 Calculate ice loads
$200 live load widget (after ifc input, new prompt shows each floor and lets user put in what load types are on each floor as a % or area in their unit of choice)
$50 Calculate remaining ASCE-7 required loads except seismic, flood, tsunami
$100 Repackage with Mythic Systems branding
$300 Test suits (confirm everything is working and resolve errors for a set of files)
$1500 Seismic addon

Note: 
	Use the codes you have on hand, and make sure you reference the codes in your comments in the codes. Yohannes, as engineer on the project your job is to make sure the code is readable, and the math is correct.
	After we get this working I will add more tasks to the project, this will become a continual project to some extent so this checklist is not the end of the job unless you guys want it to be.

Hints:
	This isn’t college, if you’re not cheating, you’re not trying – I am going to give you access to my ML developer Dawit. Please use him as a resource, he is free to you as is the gpt api access he will give you.
	I wrote all the code you see in 6 hours, having not written any code in 2 years, mostly with the help of chat gpt and engpt.
